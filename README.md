## Stories technical test

### Architecture

I've chosen MVVM as the main architecture since the project is quite new and had to be done in 4 hours.
But I tried to modulate the code as much as possible, to extract as many things as I could from the view model, such as common utils and business oriented logic. 


### Code requirements

I've tried to use async/await and SwiftUI as much as possible, as they provide a clean code readability, and are now mature enough to be in production.
